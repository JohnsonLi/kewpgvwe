Project -name-:

-Description
    -We will be making an irc-like chat program.
    -A user would be able to run the program with arguments to login with username and password.
    -After logging in, the user would see a shell-like interface, where they can run commands like
     '>join <channel-name>' or '>connect <username>'
    -After joining a channel, or connecting with a user, it would be like any normal chatroom.

-Technical Design
    -Topics covered
        -Chat history will be stored to a file
	-Semaphores will prevent two clients from writing to the same file at the same time
	-Pipes/Sockets will manage user to server/network communication
	-Processes will enable the server to handle different chats simultaneously
	-Stat will be used to check if there was new messages
